/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para> Graphics tasks won't work alone, they must be part of a <see cref="GraphicsNode"/>, which
/// contains a directed acyclic graph of graphics tasks. Graphics nodes should create their own
/// graphics task graphs at runtime, based on conditions like number of CPU threads. This scheme
/// facilitates the parallelization of the work done by a single graphics node.
/// </para>
/// <para> Rendering the frame is done in two phases.
///	The first phase (<see cref="GraphicsTask::Setup"/>) allows the node to create the resources
/// and resource view to render the current frame. By this time, all the node input ports should be
/// considered defined. Resource views are tied to the graphics task that created them,
/// and passing and using them in another graphics task will be blocked by the engine. No restrictions
/// apply to the resources themselves. Resources and view can be stored and held over multiple frames.
/// In the second phase (<see cref="GraphicsTask::Execute"/>) the node gets limited access to creation
/// of resource that are solely for this one frame, and shouldn't be stored. Besides, nodes can get access
/// to a command list which they can populate with the actual GPU rendering commands.
